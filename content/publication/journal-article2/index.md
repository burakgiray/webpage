abstract: China's Belt and Road Initiative uses credit lending to invest in infrastructure projects across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In response, the United States has increased its loan assistance and investment in these regions to curb China's influence. What are the geopolitical consequences of this increased lending? We argue that in the context of this debt diplomacy, borrowing states are more likely to use their own territory to settle debt accounts with sovereign lenders. These land holdings are then used to further the security and economic interests of the lending state. States do not have to forfeiture land and can instead continue to repay its debt, default, or seek debt relief. Each of these policy options has distinct distributional consequences for various domestic interest groups.   We argue that the relative political influence of these different interest groups determines which policy option the government will actually pursue.  We test our theoretical expectations using new data on land transactions to international actors for the years 2000 to 2018. Our results have implications of the evolution of sovereignty and speak to the consequences of official lending programs such as the Belt and Road Initiative.
