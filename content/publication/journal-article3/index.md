abstract: 	Do all troop-providers deploy peacekeepers to combat civilian victimization in conflict countries? Earlier literature suggests that the answer to this question is no. Drawing on the conflict of interest theory, I posit that divergent interests of troop-providers reduce the ideational commitment of peacekeepers to the UN; therefore, the functionality of UN peacekeeping missions. This article explores the effect of peacekeepers' ideational commitment to the UN on reducing civilian victimization by combatants in all terminated and ongoing peacekeeping operations from 1990 to 2019. The results show that ideational commitment to the UN becomes more pivotal when peacekeepers are deployed in large numbers.

summary: Not all troop-contributing countries share the same interests when they deploy personnel to a UN mission. In this study, looking at the composition of the peacekeepers, I speculate about the primary interests of the troop-contributing governments and their effect on the success of missions.
