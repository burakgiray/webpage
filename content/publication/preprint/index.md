abstract: "The European Union is well-known for its cohesive voting behavior
and its attempts to achieve a single voice within the United
Nations. However, previous studies have focused on the levels of cohesiveness
only among the core European states voting in the United
Nations General Assembly. This study expands the scholarly understanding
of EU voting behavior by examining the actions of new members
and candidate countries. Specifically, I look for changes in voting
patterns when countries would-be member states enter candidacy, and
again when they accede to the European Union as full-members. The
coherence in voting behavior between the associated country and the
EU is assessed taking an absolute difference of ideal points of those
two parties. I argue that a change in the country status also shape
the voting behavior as the interests and identities differ from those in
the past status. A statistical analysis of EU votes and country status
shows that a change in country status has a statistically significant
positive effect on the levels of cohesiveness for the newly-admitted
member states, while I find no significant results for the candidate
countries. As I find two distinct effects of change in country status,
the paper concludes with a theoretical argument on how changing
identities impact the foreign behaviors of the new nation states that
emerged in the post-Cold War era."
