I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Hertie School's Centre for International Security. My postdoctoral project **''Peacekeeping Dynamics and Local Support Mining and Analyzing Tweets from Conflict Countries''** is funded by German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). 

I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science at the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/class/political-science/graduate/job-candidates/). My main research areas include UN interventions in conflicts, the supply-side, effectiveness and legitimacy of UN peacekeeping operations, and the durability of peace settlements. 

In my dissertation, **UN Peacekeeping Operations: Conflicting Interests and Effectiveness**, I study how divergent interests of troop-providers affect the overall success of UN peacekeeping missions.
