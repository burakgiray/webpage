I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/giray)'s Centre for International Security and a visiting researcher at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research, [Uppsala University](https://www.katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N23-371). My postdoctoral project **"Peacekeeping Dynamics and Local Support Mining and Analyzing Tweets from Conflict Countries"** and my research stay in Sweden are funded by German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). 

I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science at the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/class/political-science/graduate/job-candidates/). My research focuses on various aspects of UN interventions in conflicts, including the supply-side dynamics, effectiveness, and legitimacy of UN peacekeeping operations, as well as the long-term sustainability of peace settlements.

My Ph.D. dissertation titled ["UN Peacekeeping Operations: Conflicting Interests and Effectiveness"](https://uh-ir.tdl.org/handle/10657/14470) examines the supply-side dynamics of peacekeeping and its impact on the overall effectiveness of UN missions, in which I argued that the motivations of countries deploying peacekeepers significantly influence the fulfillment of mission mandates. When troop-contributing countries prioritize their private interests over the principles of UN peacekeeping, the impartiality and neutrality of the UN are compromised. This undermines its ability to address the credible commitment problem among combatants and fulfill core mandates such as civilian protection.
